# Azure Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) Terraform Module

This module creates a DMVPN on Azure. I create this module as part of my preparation for the Azure Network Engineer Associate exam. I will use this module to create a DMVPN for my lab environment.

# Status
Initial Alpha (0.0.1). The module is not yet ready for use.

**Currently under heavy development. I may refactor the code entirely to dynamically get in touch with the features**

**ATTENTION: Applying this module will create resources that may cost money. Make sure you understand what you are doing and destroy the resources after use.**
